1. In Physics/Coherent/XSection/AREikonalSolution:
      One of the two class constructors AREikonalSolution(bool debug, ARSampledNucleus* nucl) does lead to segmentation faults 
      when using its public function Elements. A search finds no use of this particular constructor in the GENIE code.
      The other class constructor AREikonalSolution(bool debug, AlvarezRusoCOHPiPDXSec* parent) is used by the GENIE code
      and works fine.

2. In Physics/Coherent/XSection/AlvarezRusoCOHPiPXSec and Physics/Coherent/XSection/ReinSegalCOPiPXSec the function integrator
   is not unit-tested due to time limitations. To be able to do this we need to reduce the maximum number of events used 
   by the integrator. Under investigation.

3. We need to revisit the singlekaon_ut. Its current implementation is not using the BenchmarkCriteria and the numbers look
   suspect
